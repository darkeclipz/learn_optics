# Geometric Optics

This repository contains various things that I've created while studying Geometric Optics.

 * [Document with Wikipedia information](https://darkeclipz.github.io/learn_optics/optics.html) describing each topic concisely.
 * Implementation of a JavaScript optics engine (Optix) with HTML canvas.

# Applications

The following are three ideas that I'm working on when I have time.

 * Implement a 2D optics engine.
 * Implement a 3D ray tracer.
 * Implement a 3D spectral ray tracer, see reference 6.
