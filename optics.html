        <h2>1. Reflection and refraction</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Specular and diffuse reflection</h3>

        <p>
            When light hits a surface, three possible things can occur. 
            Light can be absorbed by the material, light can be transmitted through a material, or light may be reflected. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Reflected light can be divided into two sub-type, <i>specular reflection</i> and <i>diffuse reflection</i>.
            Specular reflection reflects all the light from a given direction at the same angle, whereas diffuse reflection reflects that light in a broad range of angles.
        </p>

        <p>
            What we normally think of when we talk about reflection, is <i>specular reflection</i>.  
            The ray $P$ that first hits the surface is called the <i>incident ray</i>, and the ray $Q$ that bounces of the surface is called the <i>reflected ray</i>. 
        </p>

        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/reflection.png"/>
        </div>

        <p>
            The angle $\theta_i$ between the normal of the surface and the incident ray is the <i>angle of incident</i>. 
            Likewise, the angle $\theta_r$ between the normal and the reflected ray is the <i>angle of reflection</i>.
            The fraction of light that is reflected increases with increasing angle of incidence $\theta_i$.
            The <i>Law of Reflection</i> states that $\theta_i = \theta_r$, meaning that the angle of incidence is the same as the angle of reflection. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The direction of a reflected ray is determined by the vector of incidence and the surface normal vector. 
            Given an incident direction $\hat{\mathbf{d}_i}$ from the surface to the light source and the surface normal direction $\hat{\mathbf{d_n}}$,
            the specularly reflected direction $\hat{\mathbf{d_s}}$ is:

            $$ \hat{\mathbf{d_s}} = 2 \left(\hat{\mathbf{d_n}} \bullet \hat{\mathbf{d_i}} \right) \hat{\mathbf{d_n}} - \hat{\mathbf{d_i}}, $$

            where $\hat{\mathbf{d_n}} \bullet \hat{\mathbf{d_i}}$ is a scalar product obtained with the dot product.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 Refraction and Snell's law</h3>

        <p>
            In physics, <i>refraction</i> is the change in direction of a wave passing from one medium to another or from a gradual change in the medium.
            For light, refraction follows <i>Snell's Law</i>, which states that, for a given pair of media, the ratio of the sines of the angle of incidence $\theta_1$ and the angle of refraction $\theta_2$ is equal to the ratio of phase velocities $(v_1 / v_2)$ in the two media.
            
            <div style="text-align: center">
                <img src="img/refraction.png"/>
            </div>
            
            
            This is the <i>Law of Refraction</i> and can be written as:

            $$ \dfrac{\sin\theta_1}{\sin\theta_2} = \dfrac{v_1}{v_2} $$
        </p>

        <p>
            For light, the <i>refractive index</i> $n$ of a material is more often used than the wave sphase speed $v$ in the material.
            They are, however, directly related through the speed of light through a vacuum $c$ as

            $$n = \dfrac{c}{d}.$$

            In optics, therefore, the law of refraction is typically written as

            $$n_1\sin\theta_1 = n_2\sin\theta_2. $$

            The following table contains a list of materials and the respective refractive index $n$. For liquids, the index is measured at $20^\circ \textrm{C}$.
